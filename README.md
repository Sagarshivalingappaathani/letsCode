### Project Description:
- This platform is designed to resemble popular coding websites such as LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.
-  Its primary purpose is to assist users in competitive coding. Users can solve coding problems and track their progress, including the number of problems they've solved in each topic.
-   Additionally, they can participate in coding contests to further enhance their skills.
